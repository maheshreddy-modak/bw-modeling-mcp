/**
 * Platform detection and platform-dependent tool filtering.
 *
 * One instance of this server fronts exactly one BW system, and that system is either
 * BW/4HANA or a classic release (7.5 and below). The two do not publish the same APIs:
 * transformations, DTPs and process chains have no REST resource on classic, and the whole
 * BW/4HANA family outside `/sap/bw/modeling` — the manage API behind the request monitor,
 * push, process variants, the monitoring OData services — does not exist there at all.
 *
 * Without this module the model saw the full BW/4HANA surface on a classic system, called
 * those tools first because their descriptions promise they work, and got an ICF HTTP 404
 * back. A hint in the prompt does not compete with a tool list, so the tool list is what
 * this module corrects: what a system cannot do is not offered.
 *
 * Availability is derived from the system itself wherever the system states it — the
 * discovery document lists the collections it publishes, so a tool that needs `trfn` is
 * offered exactly where `trfn` is published. Two things discovery cannot answer, and both
 * fall back to the platform verdict:
 *
 *   - APIs outside `/sap/bw/modeling` (the `/sap/bw4/…` paths, the OData services). They
 *     are not in the document, so their absence cannot be read from it.
 *   - Everything, when discovery itself could not be read.
 *
 * The scope filter in scopes.ts is independent of this and stays untouched: scopes decide
 * what a caller may invoke, this decides what the system can answer. A read-only caller on
 * a classic system sees the intersection.

/**
 * What answers the same question on a classic release, per hidden tool.
 *
 * A hidden tool is only half an answer: the model still has the question. This names the
 * call that does work, and it is the single source for both places that need to say it —
 * the message a caller gets when it invokes a hidden tool, and the instructions paragraph
 * the server sends at handshake time. Extending the coverage of `bw_read_metadata_tables`
 * therefore means adding a line here, and both texts follow.
 *
 * Deliberately not a redirect inside the tool itself. The two routes run against different
 * backends — the BW modeling REST API on one side, ADT DataPreview with direct table access
 * on the other — and keeping them in separate tools keeps that boundary where it can be
 * governed: an installation that does not grant ADT simply withholds
 * `bw_read_metadata_tables`. A tool that quietly switched backends would dissolve that
 * boundary, and it would fail silently where hiding fails visibly.
 *
 * One exception, and it is an addition rather than a switch: on a classic release `bw_xref`
 * adds the analysis processes of a provider from their metadata table, because the
 * where-used index leaves them out and no REST route to them exists on any release. The REST
 * answer is always complete on its own, the addition sits under the same `read` scope, and
 * without ADT it is skipped with a line saying so instead of failing the call. The same holds
 * for the aggregation levels of a provider and the provider of an aggregation level, which
 * `bw_xref` adds on every release.
 *
 * `topic` is what the caller was after, and is what the instructions list; several tools can
 * share one. Tools whose question has no answer on this platform at all (query data above
 * all) are absent here — there is nothing to point at yet.
