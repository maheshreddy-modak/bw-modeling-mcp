/**
 * Scope enforcement for the HTTP transport.
 *
 * Three scopes, matching three role collections:
 *   read    — everything that only reads, the modelling surface and the data alike.
 *   analyst — reporting: run a query (or query a provider directly) and everything needed to
 *             find and understand what to run. Deliberately small, and a strict subset of
 *             `read` — it exists to give a business user a client with fourteen tools instead
 *             of a hundred, not to take anything away from a reader.
 *   write   — create, update, delete, activate, push, run, unlock. Implies both others.
 * The exact counts live in tests/tool-surface.test.mjs, where they are enforced rather
 * than left to rot in a comment.
 *
 * Every analyst tool is also a read tool, so a reader lost nothing when the role was added.
 * The two are still separate sets rather than one with a flag: what belongs in a reporting
 * client is a different question from what only reads, and a tool therefore carries the *set*
 * of scopes that admit it rather than one required scope.
 *
 * The sets are the explicit part, and anything unrecognised requires `write`. That direction
 * matters: a tool added later without touching this file is unavailable to read-only callers
 * rather than silently offered to them. The opposite arrangement — listing the writes —
 * would default a new mutating tool to `read`.
 *
 * Classification comes from what the implementation actually does, not from the tool name:
 * `bw_query_data` and `bw_preview_datasource` issue POSTs but only read, while `bw_unlock`
 * looks harmless and mutates server-side lock state.
 *
 * This gates who may call the server. What a caller can actually see or change in BW is
 * decided by BW, against the ABAP user behind the request — under principal propagation
 * that is the caller themselves. Scopes restrict; they never widen.
 *
 * stdio has no authInfo and therefore no scopes: whoever runs the process already holds
 * the credentials.

/**
 * What a business user needs to ask a question of the data, and nothing else.
 *
 * Three groups: run the query, find what can be run, understand what the numbers mean. The
 * modelling surface is deliberately absent — an analyst has no use for transformations, DTPs,
 * process chains or routine source, and a client carrying all 105 tools picks the wrong one
 * far more often than one carrying fourteen. The size of this set is a feature.
 *
 * `bw_preview_datasource` is *not* here although it returns rows: it previews source-system
 * data while modelling an extraction, which is an ETL task, not reporting. It stays available
 * under `read`, as does everything else left out here — this set narrows a client, not a
 * permission.
 * `bw_list_contents` is not here either — it walks the repository tree by object type folder
 * (`adso`, `trfn`, `dtpa`), which is the modeller's way in; an analyst starts from the roles
 * assigned to them or from a search.
